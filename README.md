# Malaysia Prayer Reminder - Visual Studio Code Extension

This was built to serve as a prayer time reminder in the hope of encouraging us to perform prayers at the beginning of its times. 

It ultilized this [**Waktu Solat API**](https://zaimramlan.github.io/waktu-solat-api/) and written in **TypeScript**. This extension is inspired by a similar extension: [**Prayer Reminder**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OmarAbdulRahman.prayer-reminder).

This extension contributes the following settings:

![Minutes before prayer time reminder](images/settings.png)

* `myPrayerReminder.timer`: Enter the reminder timer.

* `myPrayerReminder.zone`: Select your prayer zone from the dropdown.

## Known Issues

* Zone of **'KTN02 Gua Musang (Daerah Galas Dan Bertam), Jeli, Jajahan Kecil Lojing'** will throw an error if selected as the API sends an empty array of prayer times for the area. 

I have submitted an issue for the API error, as for now this issue will remain error.
